This study investigates the effect of carbon risk on the ownership structure within South Korean business groups, commonly known as chaebols. How a business group will respond to an increase in carbon risk of some of their member firms is unclear. We explore changes in controlling familiesâ€™ ownership in Korean business groups following the 2015 Paris Agreement, which significantly heightened environmental consciousness among investors. We observe an increase of three percentage points in total ownership of controlling families in firms with high carbon risk after the Agreement, suggesting that the incentive to enhance control over the group outweighs the risk management incentive. This increase in ownership is mainly driven by private firms, firms that are not required to report carbon emissions, and groups that may anticipate future leadership succession. We provide further evidence that suggests business groups are at least concerned about public perception of their environmental practices.
